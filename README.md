The most of codes in MPHAC-DIS were implemented in Matlab 2022b.
In some scripts, you may need to install the Parallel Computing Toolbox in Matlab.
To convert sequencing information into binary information, a decoding demo is available in figshare (https://figshare.com/projects/MPHAC-DIS_Seq/217696).
Download the decoding demo and change the working directory to ~/DNA_storage_demo/.
Run reconstruct_Image_STJU.m.
It may take about 10 min to get a reconstructed image and the related information.
